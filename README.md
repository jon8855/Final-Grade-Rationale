# Final-Grade-Rationale

On canvas there was nothing under this assignment so I will just assume it means to write a little bit about what grade I believe I should recieve.

So in reality this has been a more than unorthradox class for me. First with Covid then forgetting the course during the fall semester has left me in a strange situation. Now I would have to say I would like to recieve the lowest possible passing grade there is but i'm not sure that I even deserve it. Regardless I did enjoy the things I did end up making. Although they arent the most prestine creations they were enjoyable to make and see the outcome. I had a lot of fun doing this all.
